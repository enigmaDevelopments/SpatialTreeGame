  layers:
  # Built-in Defaults
  - Default # 0
  - TransparentFX # 1
  - Ignore Raycast # 2
  # Custom Starts Here
  - Player # 3 - For player character physics/collision
  - Water # 4 - Built-in
  - UI # 5 - Built-in
  - Ground # 6 - Terrain, floors, static surfaces players/enemies walk on
  - Obstacle # 7 - Walls, large rocks, static colliders that block movement/LOS
  - Enemy # 8 - For enemy character physics/collision
  - Ragdoll # 9 - For physics-based ragdolls, distinct collision rules
  - PlayerProjectile # 10 - Projectiles fired by the player
  - EnemyProjectile # 11 - Projectiles fired by enemies
  - InteractableObject # 12 - Physics layer for interactable items (levers, doors)
  - Collectible # 13 - Physics layer for pickups lying on ground
  - Trigger # 14 - Volumes used *only* for trigger events (no physics collision response)
  - WorldGeometry # 15 - Detailed static world meshes, potentially different culling/collision than simple Obstacles
  - CharacterController # 16 - If using CharacterController component, sometimes useful to have its own layer
  - Vehicle # 17 - Player or AI controlled vehicles
  - Debris # 18 - Small physics objects resulting from destruction
  - Cover # 19 - Specific layer for AI cover points/objects
  - Sensor # 20 - AI sensor colliders (vision cones, hearing range) - often triggers
  - Minimap # 21 - Objects only rendered by the minimap camera
  - EffectsCamera # 22 - Objects only rendered by a secondary effects camera (e.g., weapon scope view)
  - Skybox # 23 - Layer for skybox elements if needing specific culling
  - Volume # 24 - Post Processing Volumes, Light Probe Groups, etc. Often Ignore Raycast, but layer gives option.
  - PlayerOnly # 25 - Things only the player should collide with (e.g., special triggers)
  - EnemyOnly # 26 - Things only enemies should collide with
  - VisualOnly # 27 - Objects with colliders just for visuals, no gameplay collision (e.g. distant trees)
  - DynamicObject # 28 - Movable physics objects like crates, barrels
  - NoLight # 29 - Objects that should not receive lighting (use with Culling Mask)
  - NoShadow # 30 - Objects that should not cast shadows (use with Culling Mask)
  - Debug # 31 - For debug visualizations, often culled from final builds/main camera
